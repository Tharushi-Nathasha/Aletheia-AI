# Aletheia AI

**Digital truth verification accessible to all.**  
Aletheia AI is an open-source deepfake detection toolkit that uses machine learning and computer vision to identify manipulated images and videos. The project combines a Python backend, ML models, and a web interface (React / Gradio) to give users real-time authenticity feedback with transparency and ease of use.

## 🚀 Features

- Frame-level real/fake classification using TensorFlow/Keras
- Preprocessing pipeline with OpenCV for face normalization
- Inference API (FastAPI / Flask) for serving predictions
- Web frontend (React or Gradio) for uploading media and viewing results
- Confidence scoring and explainability-ready output
- Modular architecture: ingestion, training, evaluation, deployment
- Support for open datasets (e.g., FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF)
- Designed for extensibility (video, multi-modal, explainability, etc.)

## 🧠 Motivation

In the age of synthetic media, deepfakes can erode trust, manipulate opinion, and damage reputations. Aletheia AI aims to democratize digital truth verification by providing a transparent, user-friendly, and open-source system for detecting manipulated media.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js (for frontend, if using React)
- Git

### Quickstart

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Aletheia.git
cd Aletheia

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Download and preprocess a sample dataset
python data/preprocess_sample.py

# Train a toy model
python training/train.py --data sample_data/ --epochs 2

# Run inference API
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Frontend (if using React)
cd ../../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

🛠️ Core Components
Dataset Support
FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF for real/fake media.

Preprocessing: frame extraction, face alignment/normalization, augmentation.

Model
CNN-based architecture (e.g., MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet backbone) with transfer learning.

Outputs a binary real vs. fake prediction plus confidence.

Evaluated on metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision/recall, F1.

Inference API
REST endpoint (/predict) that accepts images or video frames.

Returns prediction, confidence score, and optional explanation metadata.

Frontend
Upload interface for media.

Display of verdict (“Authentic” vs. “Deepfake”), confidence, and explanation (e.g., heatmaps).

Optionally powered by Gradio for demo or React for full UX.

🧪 Testing
pytest for unit tests (preprocessing, API inputs, model output sanity).

Integration tests to validate end-to-end flow (sample input → model → API).

Lightweight test dataset for CI to keep runs fast.

📦 Deployment
Containerize backend with Docker.

Quick demo: Hugging Face Spaces (for Gradio), Render / Cloud Run for API, Vercel for frontend.

Production: model can be served via TensorFlow Serving or embedded in the API service.
